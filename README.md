# Probability_And_Applied_Stats_Projects

This program uses the mathematical technique that predicts possible outcomes of an uncertain event. In this particular case we are seeing the probability of getting a pokemon card in a deck. This deck has 1 pokemon card and 59 energy cards. The simulation is conducted 10,000 times and at the end of each turn the number of pokemon cards in the deck goes up by one and the number of energy cards goes down by 1. After the simulations are completed, the program will provide the user the percent of chance that was to pull a pokemon card from the deck, along with the number of pokemon and energy cards at the time of each turn. This will give the user an idea of what percent is the best to get a good chance at pulling a pokemon card from the deck and what number of pokemon cards and energy cards need to be present in the deck to do so.
